PhisherMan Install Guide and Usage

Dependencies needed for PhisherMan:
Please make sure you have installed the following software packages before proceeding:
* golang (https://golang.org/)
* wkhtmltoimage (https://wkhtmltopdf.org/)


How to build PhisherMan:
PhisherMan can be easily built using the provided Makefile. Just run the following commands:
$ make fetch
$ make

How to initialize PhisherMan:
PhisherMan's root certificate must be created before PhisherMan can be used:
$ ./init_rootca.sh
Then, install the root certificate (rootCA.crt) into your browser under the "Authorities" tab.
Be sure to check the box to "Trust this certificate for identifying websites"

How to run PhisherMan:
$ ./phisherman [PORT]
Then, launch the web browser you installed the certificate into and configure it to use PhisherMan's proxy on the specified port (or the default 52078).
You may also prefer to use incognito or private browsing mode for testing as you will likely be visiting a bunch of phishing sites.
This can be easily accomplished with chrome/chromium in one command:
$ chromium-browser --incognito --proxy-server=localhost:52078
